        I am a recent graduate based in Vancouver, Canada. I have recently
        completed my Bachelors of Science in Molecular Biology/Biochemistry and
        Computer Science at Simon Fraser University. This interdisciplinary
        program allows me to combine my passion for scientific exploration with
        my technical expertise, giving me a unique perspective on
        problem-solving in both fields. I have ample experience working with
        Agile teams to develop both front-end and back-end features of various
        projects. I excel in both verbal and written communication, allowing me
        to effectively convey complex technical concepts to diverse audiences. I
        have a proven ability to quickly learn and assimilate information from
        online resources, enabling me to adapt to new technologies and tools
        efficiently. I am comfortable working in collaborative team environments
        as well as independently, adapting to the needs of the project and
        delivering high-quality results. My hobbies include working out at the
        gym, playing sports and watching movies.
